                  <p>
                    Usage of Minseo (Also referred to as the bot) requires the
                    collection and storage of some user data (Refered to as
                    "data" or "user data"). Using the bot is considered consent
                    to the collection and storage of this data. We take your
                    privacy seriously and you can read more about how we handle
                    your data below. We will comply with the Discord ToS and any
                    other applicable laws, such as GDPR.
                  </p>

                  <h4>What data is collected and why:</h4>
                  <p>
                    Data about which cards you have and you progression the bot
                    is required to operate the bot. This information includes:
                    Your discord user-id, you in-game stats (E.g. how much
                    virtual money or seeds you have), which "items" you have,
                    which "cards" you have.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you make use of the AI chat feature, the bot stores you
                    last messages along with the bot's responses so that the bot
                    can follow the conversation you are having. This applies
                    only when you are actively chatting with the the bot using
                    the commands to do so, and not other messages.
                    <br /><br />
                    Images that you have uploaded to the bot by making your own
                    cards are stored by the bot in order to ensure that the bot
                    can send the image back to you when you request it.
                    <br /><br />
                    The bot can log the usage of commands and other
                    interactions, such as button presses, to ensure that the bot
                    is working as intended and to prevent abuse. Additionally,
                    it can log trades and other interactions with other users,
                    exclusively through the bots commands. This is to prevent
                    fraud, abuse and harrassment.
                    <br /><br />
                    Minseo does not read or log your messages, and does not
                    store any excess data about you.

                    stored on an excrypted disk to ensure your privacy. Images
                    for user-made cards are store on the local encrypted drive

                    stored in a datacenter in Finland. Off-site backups may also
                    be stored, also encrypted and stored in a secure format.
                    <br />
                    The data as well as the operation of the bot is secured to
                    prevent unauthorized access to the best of our ability, but
                    we cannot accept legal liability for any unauthorized access
                    to the data.
                    <br />
                    In the case of unauthorized access to the data, the
                    developer will notify users as soon as possible though

                  <h4>AI message analysis:</h4>
                  <p>
                    The bot uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze the
                    messages you send in the chat feature to prevent abuse and
                    NSFW content. Such data may be processed by third party
                    services such as openAI. The data does not include your
                    personal information and is only sent to the third party
                    services for processing. The data is not stored by the third
                    party services and is only used to analyze the messages you
                    send to the bot. Additionally, the bot can be used by server
                    owners to moderate their servers. The bot can be configured
                    to automatically log messages that are deemed to be NSFW,
                    and can be configured to automatically delete messages that
                    are deemed to be NSFW. This feature is opt-in and only logs
                    the messages in the specific discord server, they are not
                    shard with the bot developer(s).
